Object Localization is the task of locating an instance of a particular object category in an image, typically by specifying a tightly cropped bounding box centered on the instance. In this project, I will write a custom dataset class for Image-bounding box dataset. Additionally, will apply augmentation for localization task to augment images as well as its effect on bounding box. For localization task augmentation I will use albumentation library. Will plot the (image-bounding box) pair. Thereafter, will load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network using timm library. Moreover, I am going to create train function and evaluator function which will be helpful to write training loop. Lastly, I will use best trained model to find bounding box given any image.
